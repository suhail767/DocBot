# DocBot
 This program uses the Langchain framework to build a question answering system for a single long document. The program first loads the document into memory and then splits it into smaller chunks. The chunks are then used to create embeddings, which are used to search for the most relevant documents in the vector database. The top 7 most relevant documents are then returned to the user. The program can be used with any custom document file, and it can answer questions about the content of the document.
